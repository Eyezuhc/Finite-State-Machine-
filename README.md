# Finite-State-Machine-
Finite State Machine Verilog code using Quartus and implemented on FPGA. Learning Sequential circuits using Hardware Descriptive Language
# Implementation of FPGA through Quartus
-You can use VS code for the Verilog code but in implementing the code in FPGA we used quartus from intel using the 5SCEMAF6
